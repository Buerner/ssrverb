# SSRverb

This is an attempt to bring reverberation to the [SoundScape Renderer](http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/). It was created within the scope of a masters thesis in [Audio Communication and Technology](http://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/akt/menue/studiengang_audiokommunikation_und_technologie/parameter/en/) at [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/).

The reverberation methods used include:
1. Feedback delay network with multichannel output.
2. Image source model
3. Convolution using spatialized versions of a mono impulse response.

A GUI for a reverberator using a combination of 1. and 2. is available. The incorporated ISM adapts to the position of a selectable source in the SSR. 

Also included is a command line application using the 3. method.
